# Luna Restaurant Review Project
A restaurant review app. One week Group project at SIT Academy.

## Team
A big thank you to my fellow teammates: Alexander Honegger and Alina Pankova

## Exercise
The goal of the exercise was to create the entire project from scratch.
We were given UI/UX guidelines and a list of the functionalities to implement.
After setting up a server on Digital Ocean and our CI/CD pipelines on GitLab,
we built the frontend and backend. The last two days were all about connecting the two.
That was an especially good experience in IT team-work.

## Gitlab / GitHub
The files that serve the deployment via GitLab obviously don't make a lot
of sense in a gitHub repository (i.e. gitlab-ci.yml). I still felt like sharing it here, as
the live server is not running anymore. (For financial reasons :sweat_smile: :moneybag:)
